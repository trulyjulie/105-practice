                <h4>1. <span>Confusion</span> is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Your first web app, by definition, is something you've never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and it's something so specific it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, is a signal that you're engaged in this problem-solving pursuit that blends math and technology. You're ready to dig deep, to live those aha moments on the journey to understanding.<p>
 
                <h4>2. Persistence Leads to <span>Confidence. </span></h4>
                <p>You may not know why what you're doing is working. You may not be sure what's next. It's never been so hard to "Go With the Flow" but flow you must. It's a puzzle written in a foreign language. An underwater sport on an alien planet. Every muscle's gonna ache. Every small success will surprise you. </p>
 
                <h4>3. Confusion is a <span>Crucial</span> step on your way to success! </h4>
 
                <p>All that code you're reading is training your eye to understand the language. Let the confusion roll over you like a beautiful poem until it begins to sink in. Do it until you see what it makes instead of the dots and dashes. 
                
                <h1>Do it until Confusion becomes <span>Curiosity.</span></h1>
